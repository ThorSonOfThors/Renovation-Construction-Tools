    <h2>How much grout do I need?</h2>

    <p>
    Our Grout Calculator helps professional tilers and homeowners accurately determine how much grout is needed based on total coverage area, tile dimensions, tile joint width, and tile thickness. Whether you’re planning a full renovation or working on a DIY project, this tool provides reliable calculations to help you prepare with confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
    The calculator is built using correct mathematical formulas used in the tiling industry, and its functionality was carefully advised by a professional tiler with over 20 years of real-world experience. This ensures practical, job-site accurate results rather than rough estimates.

    <p>
    By calculating grout requirements precisely, you can minimize material costs and reduce planning time. However, if your tiles have surface grit or are not perfectly smooth, we recommend adding approximately 10% extra grout as a precaution.
