    <h2>Plan Your Renovation with Precision</h2>

    <p>
      Planning a renovation and unsure how many tiles you actually need?
      Our Tile Calculator is designed for both professional tilers and
      homeowners who want accurate, reliable estimates before starting a project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built on real mathematical formulas used in the construction industry,
      it calculates tile quantity based on surface area, layout pattern,
      waste percentage, and cutting requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using precise measurements instead of rough guesses, you reduce
      costly mistakes, avoid material shortages, and plan your renovation
      with confidence and efficiency.
